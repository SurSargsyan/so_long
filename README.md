# What is the project about

This project focuses on developing a 2D game that can be interacted with using the keyboard. The task is divided into two parts: mandatory and bonus. Each part is compiled and executed separately. The bonus section includes the same features as the mandatory part, along with additional enhancements.

---

## General Instructions

1. The **Makefile** will compile your source files. It must include rules for `all` and `bonus`, corresponding to the Mandatory and Bonus parts respectively. It should not relink.
2. You are required to use **MiniLibX** for this project.
3. The program must be compiled using the following commands:

## Mandatory Instructions

1. The number of movements must be displayed in the shell.
2. Pressing `ESC` or closing the window should quit the program.
3. The map must be constructed using five components:
   1 **Walls**                                             
   C **Collectibles** (at least one)
   0 **Empty spaces**
   E **Exits** (at least one)
   P **The player** (only one)

### These five characters compose the map:

- `0` for an empty space
- `1` for a wall
- `C` for a collectible
- `E` for a map exit
- `P` for the player's starting position
